# ENCRYPTION

Just as no lock is absolutely unbreakable, no encryption can
be absolutely impossible to decrypt. With enough time and enough com-
puting power, any encryption scheme can be broken in theory. The goal
of computer security is to make an attacker’s job so difficult that successful
attacks are impossible in practice, requiring computing resources beyond
an attacker’s means.

# Transposition: Same Data, Different Order

Very weak

# Cipher Keys
