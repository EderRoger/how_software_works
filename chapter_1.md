# ENCRYPTION #

Just as no lock is absolutely unbreakable, no encryption can
be absolutely impossible to decrypt. With enough time and enough com-
puting power, any encryption scheme can be broken in theory. The goal
of computer security is to make an attacker’s job so difficult that successful
attacks are impossible in practice, requiring computing resources beyond
an attacker’s means.

## Transposition: Same Data, Different Order ##

Very weak

## Cipher Keys ##

The best defenses against known-plaintext attacks are good security
practices, such as regularly changing passwords.

## Substitution: Replacing Data ##

## Varying the Substitution Pattern ##

using a tabula recta
Polyalphabetic substitution is more effective than simple substitution
because it varies the substitution pattern throughout the message.

## Key Expansion ##

## The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) ##

* AES
  * Binary Basics
