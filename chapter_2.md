## PASSWORDS ##

* In computing, transforming something into a number in a specified range is called hashing, and the resulting number is called a hash code, hash value, or                         just plain hash.
* Full Use of All Bits
* No Reversibility
* Avalanche

 ### The MD5 Hash Function ###

 * Encoding the Password
 ** To get started, MD5 converts the password to a 512-bit block; I’ll call this the encoded password
 * Bitwise Operations - The MD5 hash function uses a few operations I haven’t discussed before. Let’s go through these briefly.
 ** Binary Addition
 ** Bitwise NOT
 ** Bitwise OR
